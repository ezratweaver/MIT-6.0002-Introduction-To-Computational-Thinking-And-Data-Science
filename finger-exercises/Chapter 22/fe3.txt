Finger exercise: The infection-fatality rate for a disease is the
number of people who contract the disease divided by the number of
those people who die from the disease. The case-fatality rate for a
disease is the number of people who are diagnosed with the disease
divided by the number of those people who die from the disease.
Which of these is easier to estimate accurately, and why? (Page 524)


Answer: Deaths would be much easier to estimate, because people who have
        a chronic disease typically end up in the hospital, over people
        who are not chronicly ill, would not end up in a hospital.
