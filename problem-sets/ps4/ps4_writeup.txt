Trends of Simulation A and Simulation B
    1. What happens to the total population before introducing the antibiotic?
        A. It grows.
        B. It grows at first, but starts waying off.
    2. What happens to the resistant bacteria population before introducing the antibiotic?
        A. It grows but stagnates.
        B. It has a little bit of growth but has a downward trend.
    3. What happens to the total population after introducing the antibiotic?
        A. It disapears almost immediately
        B. It also dies immediately.
    4. What happens to the resistant bacteria population after introducing the antibiotic?
        A. It disapears rapidly, but starts building back up.
        B. It drops, and then slowly dies out.
